# Shardmists Mod
## 3 new gamemodes
- Shard
 - can only be seen by spectator and other shard gamemodes
 - has spectator mode movement
 - can do anything a survival player can, unless being blocked by another shard
 - can spawn an item in creative mode inventory (cooldown, excluding saved hotbars) and access ender chest (replaces saved hotbar tab)
 - can influence players
 - cannot take damage or be targetted by mobs
 - has "shard only" chat
 - speaking in normal chat can be blocked by another shard
 - can control players (large cooldown, also needs to not be blocked by other shards. players can, if they know how, stop shards from controlling them)
 - sees metal as pure white (config file will let you change which blocks and items are counted as "metal")
 - only one player can be a certain shard at a time
 - can turn into an avatar or a shardmist avatar at will, assuming they are not being blocked
 - can block another shard's power, however only one shard at a time, and all cooldowns are quadrupled while blocking
 - can block even when being blocked
 - can give up power, meaning they turn to survival and the power can be absorbed by someone else
 - has infinite allomantic reserves, however brass, zinc, iron, steel, cadmium, bendalloy, nicrosil and chromium can be blocked

- Shardmist Avatar
 - can be seen by all gamemodes, and bronze allomancy reveals a line the same colour that is connected to the shard
 - has same speech requirements as shard
 - looks like a misty outline of a player
 - has survival mode movement and cannot equip armour, but can still hold items
 - cannot take damage or be targetted by mobs
 - cannot influence players
 - can turn into an avatar or a shard at will
 - does not have creative mode item spawn but can still access ender chest
 - has infinite allomantic reserves
 - sees metal as pure white

- Avatar
 - can be seen by all gamemodes, looks like a normal survival mode player
 - has infinite allomantic reserves, however they refill over time rather than instantly refilling like the shard and shardmist avatar.
 - does not have creative mode items spawn and needs an ender chest in order to access their ender chest inventory
 - cannot influence players
 - can speak like a normal survival mode player, as well as speaking in shard chat
 - burning bronze as a shard, shardmist avatar or avatar also shows a coloured line with the colour based on the colour of the shard, meaning that shards can see who is an avatar
 - sees metal as metal
